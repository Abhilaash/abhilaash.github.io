<p>
I also enjoyed reading Catcher in the Rye during my summer vacations. My other
required book, <i>The Mayflower</i>, was extremely boring. This school year, I would like to reread the 
Percy Jackson and the Heroes of Olympus series before the release of the last book in the
Heroes of Olympus series.
