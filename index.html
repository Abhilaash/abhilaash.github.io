					<h4><strong><a href="https://anant.us/Home.aspx">Anant Corporation</a></strong>:
					<small>I made a program for a startup company that would takes in data and displays it in a manner that is easier to read. It helps the company understand where they're spending the most money as well as their future contacts and how much potential money they can make.

					<h4><strong><a href="http://www.cghtech.com/">CGH Technologies</a></strong>:
					<small>I made a mobile application for a government subcontractor that displays NOTAMs (Notices to Airmen) in a manner that is easier to read. NOTAMs are used to notify aircraft about any issues at the airport. Generally NOTAMs can take even a skilled reader a minute to decipher, however, my application can parse it and make it easy enough for even the general public to understand in seconds. I was able to present this at the AIXM conference.<br><br>
